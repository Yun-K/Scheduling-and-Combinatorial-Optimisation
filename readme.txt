I am using the python for this assignment, so program.zip and source.zip are actually the same.

I use jupyter notebook for all parts, so you can clearly observe the results by opening the jupyter notebook. 
For part 1 and part 2, the p1p2.ipynb can be found under the p1p2 directory, 
and For part 3 and part 4, the p3p4.ipynb can be found under the root directory. In addition, local-search-tsp.ipynb is also included for comparison purposes in order to write the part 3 report. 


I have transformed all *.ipynb to *.py files as well, so you can run my programms using the command line as well. 
Below are the steps and commands to run my programs:

First, u need to unzip the program.zip and `cd` to the program directory, 
    such as: > cd program

then, rest of this readme.txt contains commands to run the *.py for each part, you can just copy and paste in the terminal.

Part 1 and Part 2: 
    > python p1p2.py

Part 3 and Part 4:
    > python p3p4.py
