I am using the python for this assignment, so program.zip and source.zip are actually the same.

I use jupyter notebook for all parts, so you can clearly observe the results by opening the jupyter notebook.

    such as: > cd program

then, rest of this readme.txt contains commands to run the *.py for each part:

Part 1 and Part 2: 
    > python p1p2/p1p2.py

Part 3 and Part 4:
